## Name

In short: Pronounced "quiz-like"

The name is a Norwegian almost-word essentially meaning quiz-as-adjective-converted-to-noun (Quizzyness), but can also be intepreted as "quiz" + "playing around" (Quizplay). Among less literal interpretations, it sounds a bit like new-norwegian question-words like "kvifor" (Why) and "korleis" (How), and it evokes the feelings of the most common "-leik"-suffixed word: "kj√¶rleik" (Love)

It is a nice sounding name with a lot of layers and a neat close-enough pronounciation in English as "Quiz-like", and according to internet searches it is not a real word, which makes it perfect for a name!
