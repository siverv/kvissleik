## Name

The name is a made-up norwegian almost-word essentially meaning quiz-as-adjective-converted-to-noun, but can also be intepreted as "quiz" + "playing around".

The pronounciation is fairly similar to "quiz-like" in English. If you want a literal translation, consider "Quizzyness" or "Quizplay".
